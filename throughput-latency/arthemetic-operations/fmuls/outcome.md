In both independent as well as dependent case the loop ran for 2^28 times while each iteration had 2^5 operation.

$$Throughput = \frac{480 * 10^{6} * 19.176}{2^{28} * 2^{5}}$$
$$Latency = \frac{480 * 10^{6} * 72.132}{2^{28} * 2^{5}}$$
$$Throughput = 1.07$$
$$Latency = 4.03$$

Here the latency is 4 times throughput suggesting there are 4 such arthematical unit.
